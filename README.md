# Local Library Project
The Local Library project is designed to manage the lending and borrowing of books in a neighborhood library. The main goal is to create a dashboard that tracks book availability, borrowing statistics, and other administrative tasks for library users. This project focuses on building algorithms that work with large datasets, specifically for managing books, accounts, and authors.

## Features
Track Book Availability: Identify which books are currently available or checked out.
Borrowing History: View transaction logs of each book, including whether it has been returned.
Author and Account Information: Link books to their respective authors and view borrower details.
Library Statistics: Generate data-driven insights such as the most borrowed books and active borrowers.
